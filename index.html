                    <h2>Hello, I'm Obdulio</h2>

                    <h5>Majoring in UX Interface and Web Design</h5>

                    <p>Currently enrolled at Raritan Valley Community College as a full time student. I wanted to major in something that engaged my creative side as I always loved reading and drawing. I want a career that lets me persue and continue working on my creativity while also including my love for technology. I've enjoyed leaning about HTML and CSS while taking this Web Development 1 class as I've always found that trying to learn how to code on my own was so daunting to me as it was so overwhelming. Im glad I've taken my first step in trying to learn what a few months ago I would have found impossible to do. </p>

                    <h3> Drawing </h3>

                    <p>I like drawing from time to time, when I get a small burst of inspiration. Most of the time I do doodles but I never tend to finish them. I always get so caught up in trying to make it as perfect as I invisioned it to be, that ultimatley I end up dissapointed with my work and leave it unfinished. I love drawing low fantasy and creating monsters for a bestieary.</p>

                    <h3> Reading </h3>

                    <p>One of my favorite manga is the "Mob Psycho 100" series. The art is very crude and simple but that is why I love it. The author didn't let his lack of skill in art stop him from creating the series. It tells such a beautiful and funny coming of age story of a middle schooler just trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. </p>

                    <p>I have two cats named "Morgana" and "Haru". I love them deeply and I believe they understand that love. They always follow me around and always trying to make me pet them. Morgana even lets me craddle him like a baby in my arms. I spend a lot of my time on my computer so you'll usually find them curled up sleeping on the bed next to me.</p>

                <h1>Embedded static Google map using iFrame</h1>

                <p>With more than 150 million monthly users, Google maps is a great implementation to a website. This is especially true for websites that need to show their users locations to their businesses. These businesses can include retail stores, restaurants, and other business that will need their clients to locate them in person. There are many benefits to embedding a map into your website such as it helps customers or website visitors get directions to your business without the need of having to leave your website and opening another browser window. Having all the information needed on one location is very user intuitive and lessens the stress on the user to find the information all on their own which could end up being wrong. </p>

                <p>Another benefit of implementing google maps onto your website is that it acts almost like another contact form. Google maps could be used complimenting your “Contact Us” form as if the business is already registered with google it can show very useful information. This information can be used as an alternative way to contact you as Google maps would contain your business address, phone number, any more website links, directions, reviews, review stars, and much more information already set up by google.</p>
                    
                <p>Google will also highlight other areas of interest around your location. This information can be useful as it gives the viewer a sense of location making it easier for them to locate. Google maps highlights attractions such as parking areas, restaurants, theaters, parks, etc. Making it very useful for viewers to plan and navigate how they plan to get and then do once they arrive to the location. It can also be used for advertisement purposes, for example if your website is walking distance from a mode of transportation like train stop or bus stop, it may change how someone would visit your location. Also, for businesses with multiple locations it will help users find which one exactly they want to go to.</p>
                    
                <p>Google also shows a lot of useful information. Other than your basic contact like phone number and address. It shows things like business hours, ratings, menu link for restaurants, peak hours, photos, and much more. This is all super intuitive to the user as it will allow them to plan accordingly make accommodations for themselves. An example of how useful this information can be is if someone is anxious around large crowds, google maps showing peak hours for a business like a restaurant of a gym would allow the viewer to plan their trip accordingly when there are less people. </p>
                    
                <p>With how much information and benefits google maps offer not only the website viewer but also the website owner themselves, how do you implement one into your own website? Using an embedded link and iframe tag, we can implement an embedded map onto our website just like we did in an assignment earlier this semester of Web Development 1 with professor Steve Caruso. Navigate to google maps and find the location you want to pin on your website. Click share on go onto the “embed a map” tab and it will give you a link. In your HTML file, paste the link you copied. Embed automatically uses the iframe and src tags. All you must do is style it according to where you want it and how you want it to look. For my demonstration I have embedded the Google map location for college I am currently attending Raritan Valley Community College.</p>
