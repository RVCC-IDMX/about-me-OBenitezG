### What I learned:

During the course I stuggled with flex and grid. I didn't really know how to incorporate it or the divs wouldnt alighn the way I intended them to. After doing the navbar it really helped me with understanding how to use flex properly. After I watched some youtube videos on flex and grid to better understand and deepen my knowledge on it. I then used flex for my gallery section where I devided each section evenly. Then for smaller screens the solution was as simple as changing flex from displaying row to displaying into columns instead. Then for the article I used grid to devide it between text and the embedded google map. The change and growth is very apparent when compared to my midterm I tried attempting to use flex and grid but ultimatly gave up on it. When viewing my midterm website on smaller screens everything starts to stack on one another. Im glad since then i've been able to work on one of my weaknesses.

For the cholor scheme I used darker colors for the background so the letters can really pop and be readable. I needed to use dark colors because without it, my website looked like a giant white canvas with black text. Making it very hard to look at. With more practice and better use of layout I wouldn't have to rely on the dark color background. I could make it more intricate but for now I am very happy with how my website came out. Before this course I wouldn't even know where to begin and since the midterm I have improved gradualy.
